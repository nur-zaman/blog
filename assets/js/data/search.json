You can check your Wallet info via,$ .\\bitcoin-cli -regtest getwalletinfoGenerating a new addressTo generate blocks we need to get an address first. We do that by,$ .\\bitcoin-cli -regtest getnewaddressIt will give you a hash value as an address ; you should copy this address and generate 101 blocks with the command shown in the next step.$ .\\bitcoin-cli -regtest generatetoaddress 101 your-hash-stringIn the console it will output the generated blocks and you will be able to check your balance up next.Checking balance and making transactionsTo check balance the CLI command is,$ .\\bitcoin-cli -regtest getbalanceThe output should be 50.00 or more if you have followed previous steps correctly.Making TransactionsTo simulate transactions between two address we need to generate a new address. So we again generate a new address by using ,$ .\\bitcoin-cli -regtest getnewaddresssuppose the address we got from here is second-hashWe are going to send 20 bitcoin to this address. So we will be using -named flag to set the address , amount and fee rate.$ .\\bitcoin-cli -regtest -named sendtoaddress address=second-hash amount=20.0 fee_rate=2 Be sure to change second-hash with the address you got previouslyif the transaction is successful it will show a transaction ID.If you want to get detailed information about the transaction you can use the command below.$ .\\bitcoin-cli -regtest gettransaction &amp;lt;transaction-id&amp;gt;And those were some basic functionalities of bitcoin-core in regtest mode.
